Friend Finder - Node & Express Servers
GT Coding Bootcamp
Overview
In this activity, build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- sort of like a "dating app".

This app has a Drag Queen theme. It will let the user submit a form of 10 questions and let them know which drag queen persona they best match up to. The app will display the image of the person with the best overall match.

Technologies Used:
HTML
CSS
Javascript
Express
Node
